#Wireframe Testing

##Test number 1
###Subject
50s female tourist from Sydney; customer at Scarecrow
###Setup
Follow the 'links' as you desire and I will
###Results
First 'click' to "Posie of the Week" which has no page to land on. This would be an unlinked page, with most traffic coming from social media.
Second click to latest recipe, also with no page to land on. This would require a timestamp function on recipe posts to allow for the app to pull it.
###Subject Remarks
I'm impressed with places like this who share their recipes.
I know a similar place who write up a recipe of the week on a blackboard in the cafe.
Found the experience a bit confising.
###Conclusion
People head to the icons in the middle of the page before the nav bar.
Need to make these icons lead to places people want to go.

##Test number 2
###Subject
Alison, store owner and florist manager
###Setup
Pretend you're a customer and buy some flowers.
###Results
First clicked on the Posie of the week, then found the tab in the nav bar.
Followed the step-by-step to purchase Bohemian flowers without fail.
###Remarks
Said it was easy, fun, clean and not frustrating.
Suggested including a customisable field in the 'Occasion' step.
The experience didn't seem to engage her in the story or values of Scarecrow.
###Conclusion
Need to have some simple, clear text that captures who we are and why we exist in <10 words per message.

##Test number 3
###Subject
Izzie, florist.
###Setup
Pretend you're a customer and buy some flowers.
###Results
Followed the prompts easily after initially going for the Posie of the Week.
Interestingly chose exactly the same options as Alison.
###Remarks
Enjoyed the experience, found it easy.
Suggests including a specification for colour palette, and more of a description for each of the flower styles.
###Conclusion
The flow is user friendly and logical. There may need to be an icon on the front page pointing to the flowers, or some other navigation to flowers from the front page.
